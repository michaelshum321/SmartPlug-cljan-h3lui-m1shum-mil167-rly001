# SmartPlug
## ECE 140A Group

A project that uses a Raspberry Pi, Flask, SQLite, and a simple front-end to give our users a dashboard to read instant and historical sensor data surrounding plants.

The sensors used are 
* Humidity
* Light
* Temperature

Users can check the dashboard to track the liveliness of their plants - maybe they need watering or to be moved to a brighter location.
